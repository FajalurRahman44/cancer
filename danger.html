  <h2>Introduction </h2>
  <p>One of the deadliest diseases responsible for about 9.5 million lakh deaths in 2018, according to WHO, is cancer. Cancer is a term used to describe a large group of diseases that are characterized by cellular malfunction. Cancer is the deregulation of cell growth. In medical terms, cancer is known as malignant neoplasm; a broad group of diseases involving unregulated cell growth, and the unregulated cell growth forms a "tumour." Cancer can start anywhere in the human body which is made up of a trillion cells.

  

    When cells become old or damaged they die and new cells take their place. But when cancer develops, this orderly process breaks down. Old and damaged cells survive when they should die and new cells form when they are not needed. These extra cells can divide without stopping and may form tumours.

  <h2>What is cancer?</h2>
  <p>Cancer is a disease in which some of the bodys cells grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body. 

    Cancer can start almost anywhere in the human body, which is made up of trillions of cells. Normally, human cells grow and multiply (through a process called cell division) to form new cells as the body needs them. When cells grow old or become damaged, they die, and new cells take their place.
    
    Sometimes this orderly process breaks down, and abnormal or damaged cells grow and multiply when they shouldnt. These cells may form tumors, which are lumps of tissue. Tumors can be cancerous or not cancerous (benign).

  <h2>what are its types?</h2>
  <p>There are more than 100 types of cancer. Types of cancer are usually named for the organs or tissues where the cancers form. For example, lung cancer starts in the lung, and brain cancer starts in the brain. Cancers also may be described by the type of cell that formed them, such as an epithelial cell or a squamous cell.

    You can search NCIs website for information on specific types of cancer based on the cancers location in the body or by using our A to Z List of Cancers. We also have information on childhood cancers and cancers in adolescents and young adults.
    
    Here are some categories of cancers that begin in specific types of cells:
    They are
    </p>
   <h3>1.carcinoma</h3>
   <h3>2.sarcoma</h3>
   <h3>3.Leukemia</h3>
   <h3>4.lymphoma</h3>
   <h3>5.multiple myeloma</h3>
   <h3>6.melanoma</h3>
   <p>Apart from that there is more types of cancer</p>

    <h2>how does cancer develop?</h2>
       <p>Cancer is a genetic disease—that is, it is caused by changes to genes that control the way our cells function, especially how they grow and divide.

        Genetic changes that cause cancer can happen because:
        
        of errors that occur as cells divide. 
        of damage to DNA caused by harmful substances in the environment, such as the chemicals in tobacco smoke and ultraviolet rays from the sun. (Our Cancer Causes and Prevention section has more information.) 
        they were inherited from our parents. </p>

     <h2>symptoms</h2>
       <p>Signs and symptoms caused by cancer will vary depending on what part of the body is affected.

        Some general signs and symptoms associated with, but not specific to, cancer, include:</p>
           <h3>1.fatigue</h3>
           <h3>2.difficulty swallowing</h3>
           <h3>3.changes in bladder and bowel habits</h3>
           <h3>4.persistent coughor trouble breathing</h3>
           <h3>5.weight unintended weight loss or gain</h3>
           <h3>6.skin changes such as yellowing,darkening and redness of the skin</h3>

     <h2>how does cancer spread?</h2>
        <p>In order to spread, some cells from the primary cancer must break away, travel to another part of the body and start growing there. Cancer cells don't stick together as well as normal cells do. They may also produce substances that stimulate them to move.

     <h2>Preventive measures of cancer</h2>
       <h3>1.do not use tobacco</h3>
       <h3>2.Maintain a healthy diet</h3>
       <h3>3.Maintain a healthy weight and be physically active</h3>
       <h3>4.protect yourself from sun</h3>
       <h3>5.Get vaccinated</h3>
       <h3>6.Avoid risky behaviour</h3>
       <h3>7.Get medical chechup</h3>

   <h2>conclusion</h2>
     <p>Cancer is a dangerous disease, but it can be cured. Required instruments should be provided to the hospitals so that the screening and initial detection of cancer can be done at the early stage. In national health insurance, the treatment of cancer should be included with an emphasis on providing financial support to the patient and his family. The expensive immune and targeted therapies should not only be for those upper-income people. These facilities should be made accessible to all people at affordable costs. Thus, it will increase access to health services and strengthen the health systems for low and middle-income people.
